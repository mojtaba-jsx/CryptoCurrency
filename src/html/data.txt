    "body": "The creator of Bitcoin, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern technology and finance. The true identity of this individual or group of people is still unknown. In 2008, a paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published by Satoshi Nakamoto, outlining the principles and ideas behind Bitcoin. The following year, the Bitcoin software and its open-source code were introduced. Nakamoto devised a blockchain-based system that allows users to conduct direct and decentralized transactions. This technology operates on principles of security, transparency, and eliminating the need for financial intermediaries. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto's identity, they have left a significant impact on financial and technological culture. Bitcoin is not just a digital currency but a social and cultural movement aiming to establish a decentralized financial system independent of banks and financial intermediaries. The global economic and political conditions at the time of Bitcoin's emergence, rampant resource hoarding, and relentless inflation were the primary motivations for Satoshi in creating Bitcoin. They sought to provide a financial system that redistributes power from central authorities and the wealthy to the broader community. Although Satoshi Nakamoto has yet to reveal their true identity, the legacy they have left to the Bitcoin community and the blockchain technolo y sector is unparalleled. The ideas and principles they introduced have been rapidly embraced worldwide, evolving into a global movement.",

    "subject": "How is bitcoin obtained?",
    "body": "Bitcoin mining is the process of encrypting and validating transactions on the Bitcoin network, carried out by miners using computational power to solve complex mathematical problems. Miners use specialized computer equipment called ASIC to solve these problems. When a miner successfully solves a problem, new transactions are added to the blockchain, and the miner receives newly minted bitcoins as a reward. The mining process is not only used for validating transactions but also for minting new bitcoins. With the advancement of the network and an increase in the number of miners, the complexity of the problems and the difficulty of mining have also increased. Since mining requires significant computational power, a considerable amount of energy is consumed in this process. This has led to some criticism regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. Currently, Bitcoin mining is recognized as an industrial activity and investment. Due to the increasing complexity and costs involved, some miners have relocated to regions with cheaper energy. Ultimately, Bitcoin mining is not only the foundation of the security of the Bitcoin network but also one of the most significant factors cont ibuting to the success and widespread adoption of this digital currency. This process ensures the trustworthiness and reliability of Bitcoin by validating transactions.",

TON was backed by a cryptocurrency called Gram, which was intended to be used for internal and international transactions within the Telegram platform. This digital currency was developed with unique features and capabilities, including smart contracts and platform-specific tokens. After raising over $1.7 billion from investors in an initial coin offering (ICO), Telegram faced legal challenges from regulatory authorities. This led to delays and partial refunds of the investments. Ultimately, due to legal conflicts and governmental pressures, Telegram canceled the TON project. This decision eroded trust among some of the project's audience and investors regarding Telegram's blockchain initiatives. Despite the cancellation of TON, Telegram remains committed to blockchain technology and continues its research and development in this field.",
